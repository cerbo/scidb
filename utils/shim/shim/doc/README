I've switched the API doc to use R markdown and knitr. This way the API
examples are actually _run_ as part of the doc creation process (effectively
another level of tests).

Open the help.Rmd document in RStudio. It assumes that shim is running on
localhost and port 8080. Then create the processed help.html file and copy
it after success to the wwwroot/help.html file.
