# What's new (for SciDB 15.12)

This is likely to be the last version of the shim. Bryan will be switching the
R client to use JDBC, and all other clients are encouraged to migrate too.

## Support for the SciDB advanced I/O toolbox (_aio_tools_)

Use the `-a` command line flag, or add the line
```
aio=1
```
to the `/var/lib/shim.conf` file to save data using the SciDB aio_tools plugin (required).

## SciDB native authentication

But only for the  `/execute_query` and `/cancel` services (the only services that really
talk directly to SciDB). If you need to protect the other shim services, consider using
digest authentication.

## Streaming and compression options no longer supported

The `execute_query` service no longer supports either option, if you use these
options they will be ignored.


# Overview

Shim is a web service that exposes a very simple API for clients to interact
with SciDB over HTTP connections. The API consists of a small number of
services (described in detail below), including: `/new_session`,
`/release_session`, `/execute_query`, `/cancel`, `/read_lines`, `/read_bytes`,
`/upload_file`, `/upload`, `/version`.

There are more direct ways to talk to SciDB over a network. See
https://github.com/artyom-smirnov/scidb4py for a great example of direct
network communication with SciDB using Python and Google protocol buffers
(written by Artyom Smirnov, one of the core SciDB developers). Artyom's
approach is comparatively low-level, but possibly more efficient than shim.
Shim is designed to be a convenient and easy way to talk to SciDB. Note that
both shim and Artyom's Python interface are community open source projects;
they are not official components of SciDB.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
if(! require(jpeg, quietly=TRUE)) install.packages('jpeg',,'http://www.rforge.net/') 
x = readJPEG("shim.jpg")
p = par(mar=c(0,0,0,0))
plot(1:2,type="n",xaxt="n",yaxt="n",bty="n",xlab="",ylab="",asp=1)
rasterImage(x, 1,1,2,2)
par(p)
```

Shim clients begin by requesting a session ID from the service, then running a
query and releasing the session ID when done. Session IDs are distinct from
SciDB query IDs--a  shim session ID groups a SciDB query together with server
resources for input and output to the client.


# Configuration

Shim runs as a system service or can be invoked directly from the command line.
See the shim manual page for command-line options (type `man shim` from a
terminal). Service configuration is determined by the `/var/lib/shim/conf`
configuration file. The default conf file is a sample that displays the default
configuration options, which are listed as one key=value pair per line.
Available options include: 

```
#ports=8080,8083s
scidbport=1239
instance=0
tmp=/home/scidb/scidbdata/000/0/tmp
#user=root
#max_sessions=50
#timeout=60
#aio=1
```

Each option is described below.


## Ports and Network Interfaces

Shim listens on default ports 8080 (open, not encrypted), and 8083 (TLS
encrypted) on all available network interfaces. Ports and listening interfaces
are configured with the command line '-p' option or with the 'ports=' option in
the `/var/lib/shim/conf` file when shim is run as a service. The
ports/interface specification uses the following syntax:

```
[address:]port[s][,[address:]port[s]][,...]
```
where:

- *address* indicates an optional I.P. address associated with a specific
  available network device, only specify this if you want to restrict shim to
  operate on a specific network device.
- *port* indicates a required available port number
- *s* is an optional single character 's' suffix indicating that TLS/SSL should be used on that port.

Here are some examples of possible port configurations:

<table>
<tr><td>5555s <td style='padding-left:30px;'> <td> Listen only on port 5555 (TLS/SSL).
<tr><td>127.0.0.1:8080,1234s <td> <td>List on port 8080 but only on the local loopback interface; listen on port 1234(TLS/SSL) on all interfaces.
</table>

## SciDB Port

Shim runs on the same computer as a SciDB coordinator. Set the 'scidbport'
option to select the coordinator database port to locally connect to. The
default SciDB database port value is 1239 (see the SciDB configuration manual
for more information). Since any SciDB instance can act as a query coordinator,
it is possible to configure multiple shim services, for example one shim
service per computer IP address.

## Instance

Set the SciDB instance number to use as a query coordinator. Make sure that
this option is set together with the corresponding SciDB port number for the
instance, and also set a corresponding temporary I/O location that the instance
has read/write access to.

## Temporary I/O space

Shim's default behavior caches the output of SciDB queries in files on the
SciDB server; set that file directory location with the config file tmp option
or the command-line -t argument. This temporary directory is also used to
upload data from clients over the http connection for input into SciDB. Select
a directory that is writable by the shim user (see the user option).

If you install shim from an RPM or Debian package as a service, the package
will configure shim to use a SciDB data directory for temporary storage. You
can edit the config file and restart shim to change that default.


## User

The user that the shim service runs under (shim can run as a non-root user).

## Max sessions

Set the maximum number of concurrent _shim_ sessions, beyond which clients receive an HTTP 'resource unavailable' error.

## Timeout

Set the time in seconds after which an _inactive_ session is considered timed out and a candidate for resource de-allocation.
After sessions time out their resources are not freed unless the need to be to satisfy additional session demands. See the
lazy timeout section below. Active sessions that are waiting on SciDB query results or transferring data are not subject
to timeout and may run indefinitely.

## AIO plugin

Set `aio=1` in the config file to enable fast AIO save using the SciDB aio_tools plugin.


## TLS/SSL Certificate

Shim supports TLS/SSL encryption. Packaged versions of shim (RPM and Debian packages) generate a self-signed certificate and 4096-bit RSA key when shim is installed. The certificate is placed in `/var/lib/shim/ssl_cert.pem`. If you would prefer to use a different certificate, replace the automatically generated one.



# API Reference

Examples use the URL `http://localhost:8080` or `https://localhost:8083` (TLS) below.
Parameters are required unless marked optional. All shim API services support CORS, see http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/ .


## Limits

HTTP 1.1 clients or greater are required.

All HTTP query parameters are passed to the service as string values. They are
limited to a maximum of 4096 characters unless otherwise indicated (a notable
exception is the SciDB query string parameter, limited to 262,144 characters).

HTTP query string parameters that represent numbers have limits. Unless
otherwise indicated whole-number values (session ID, number of bytes to return,
etc.) are interpreted by shim as signed 32-bit integers and are generally
limited to values between zero and 2147483647. Values outside that range will
result in an HTTP 400 error (invalid query).

## Response codes

Possible responses for each URI are listed below. HTTP status code 200 always
indicates success; other standard HTTP status codes indicate various errors.
The returned data may be UTF-8 or binary depending on the request and is always
returned using the generic application/octet-stream MIME type. Depending on the
request, data may used chunked HTTP transfer encoding and may also use gzip
content encoding.


## Basic digest access authentication

Shim supports basic digest access authentication. (See
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication and the references
therein for a good description of the method.) Enable digest access
authentication by creating an .htpasswd file in shim's default
`/var/lib/shim/wwwroot` directory (the .htpasswd file must be located in shim's
wwwroot directory, which can be changed with the command line switch -r). The
format of the file must be:

```
username1:password1
username2:password2
...
```

Use plain text passwords in the file, and consider changing the permissions of
the file to restrict access.  Delete the .htpasswd file to disable basic digest
access authentication.

Basic digest authentication works on plain or TLS-encrypted connections but can
not be used in combination with SciDB authentication (see below).


## TLS/SSL encryption

Shim optionally exposes both open and encrypted (HTTPS/TLS) services. You can
provide a signed certificate in the `/var/lib/shim` directory. A generic
random unsigned certific is automatically generated for you if you install
shim using either the .deb or .rpm package installer.


## SciDB authentication

See the `/execute_query` service documentation below.


## Generic API Workflow

```
/new_session
/execute_query
/read_lines or /read_bytes
/release_session
```


## API Service Endpoints

The R examples below use the `httr` package. We try to illustrate API calls
with real examples using either curl or R.  See

<tr><td>NOTES <td>
Shim only supports AFL queries. 
<p>
Remember to URL-encode the SciDB query string.
<p>
Specify optional user and password information for SciDB authentication. The password must be encoded as
`base64( sha512("plain text password") )` -- authentication requires a TLS encrypted connection.
<p>
500 and 503 errors result in removal of the web session ID and related resources (thus, `release_session` does not have to be called after such an error). 
<p>
This method blocks until the query completes.
<p>
Do not specify the option release=1 when the save option is also set, or output will not be available to `read_bytes` or `read_lines`. Instead, explicitly call `release_session` after reading is complete.

This method is faster and easier to use than the older `/upload_file` method.
<tr><td>EXAMPLE (curl)
<td>
```{r, engine='bash'}

# Release our session ID
httr::GET(sprintf("http://localhost:8080/release_session?id=%s", session))
```
</table>



# Orphaned Sessions

Shim limits the number of simultaneous open sessions. Absent-minded or
malicious clients are prevented from opening too many new sessions repeatedly
without closing them (which could eventually result in denial of service). Shim
uses a lazy timeout mechanism to detect unused sessions and reclaim them. It
works like this:

- The session time value is set to the current time when an API event finishes.
- If a new_session request fails to find any available session slots, it inspects the existing session time values for all the sessions, computing the difference between current time and the time value. If a session time difference exceeds a timeout value, then that session is harvested and returned as a new session.
- Operations that may take an indeterminate amount of time like file uploads or execution of SciDB queries are protected from harvesting until the associated operation completes.

The above scheme is called lazy as sessions are only harvested when a new session request is unable to be satisfied. Until that event occurs, sessions are free to last indefinitely.

Shim does not protect against uploading gigantic files nor from running many long-running SciDB queries. The service may become unavailable if too many query and/or upload operations are in flight; an HTTP 503 (Service Unavailable) error code is returned in that case.
